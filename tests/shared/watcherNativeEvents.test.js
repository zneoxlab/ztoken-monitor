// not a crash but silence, and silence looks exactly like an idle machine.
//
// So this file talks to the real filesystem with the real production options
// (watcherOptions, imported rather than restated, so the two cannot drift) and
// asserts that a write produces an event. CI runs the suite on ubuntu-latest,
// windows-latest and macos-latest, so this is the check that keeps native
// events honest on the two platforms the maintainer cannot test by hand.
//
// It asserts delivery, never latency. A shared CI runner is far too noisy for a
// timing assertion, and a flaky test in this position would get muted, which
// costs exactly the coverage it exists to provide.
