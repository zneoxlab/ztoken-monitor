// Every other watcher test mocks chokidar, which means none of them can tell
// whether native file events actually arrive on the platform running them.
// That gap is the whole risk in watching without polling: the failure mode is
// not a crash but silence, and silence looks exactly like an idle machine.
//
// So this file talks to the real filesystem with the real production options
// (watcherOptions, imported rather than restated, so the two cannot drift) and
// asserts that a write produces an event. CI runs the suite on ubuntu-latest,
// windows-latest and macos-latest, so this is the check that keeps native
// events honest on the two platforms the maintainer cannot test by hand.
//
// It asserts delivery, never latency. A shared CI runner is far too noisy for a
// timing assertion, and a flaky test in this position would get muted, which
// costs exactly the coverage it exists to provide.

// awaitWriteFinish holds an event for stabilityThreshold (500 ms) before it is
// emitted, so the floor is already half a second before any scheduling noise.
// The bound is generous on purpose: this asserts that events arrive at all, so
// the only thing a tighter bound buys is a faster failure on a starved runner,
// at the cost of failing for a reason that has nothing to do with the watcher.

// Why the writes below are retried rather than done once after `ready`.
//
// chokidar's `ready` means "the initial directory scan finished", NOT "the
// native stream is delivering". A file created between those two moments is
// reported by neither: ignoreInitial suppresses the scan, and the stream's
// start point is already past the file's creation. That event is lost for good,
// while any later write to the same path arrives normally.
//
// Measured on darwin with the repro that found this: writing once immediately
// after `ready` lost the event in 0/120 runs single-process, but 27% of runs
// with eight watcher processes in parallel — which is what `node --test` does
// to this file. Every failure had the same shape: no first event, and a second
// write to the same path delivered ~610 ms later. That is the ~15% CI flake.
//
// Re-touching until an event lands does not weaken anything. A watcher that is
// genuinely not delivering never produces an event however many times the file
// is written; only the unobservable scan/stream boundary is retried away. It
// also makes the pruning assertion below stronger, because by the time it runs
// the stream is proven live rather than assumed live.
const TOUCH_INTERVAL_MS = 1500;

// Retrying an individual write is not enough on its own: if the action being
// tested is `mkdir`, its addDir is what falls into the gap, chokidar never
// starts watching the new directory, and no amount of writing inside it will
// ever produce an event. So prove the stream is delivering with a throwaway
// file first, and only then let the test do what it came to do.
//
// `liveDir` must be a path the watcher is not pruning — for a test that passes
// an `ignored` matcher, the sentinel goes in a directory that matcher keeps.
