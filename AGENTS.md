# AGENTS.md

This is the single source of project guidance, shared by every coding agent (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, …). `CLAUDE.md` is a Claude Code compatibility shim that just imports this file — edit **this** file, not `CLAUDE.md`.

## Commands

```bash
npm start          # launch the Electron widget (= npm run widget / npm run dev)
npm run hub        # start the Node hub on port 17321
npm run agent      # start the headless collector→hub agent
npm run agent:once # one-shot collect+post, then exit (useful for cron/launchd)
npm test           # run the node:test suite (node --test "tests/**/*.test.js")
npm run lint       # ESLint flat config (eslint.config.js)
npm run verify     # lint + test (single local entry point)
```

Automated verification is `npm run verify` (= `npm run lint && npm test`). The toolchain (ESLint 10 + the node:test glob) needs Node 22.13+, which is why `engines.node` is `>=22.13.0` (Node 18 & 20 are both EOL as of 2026-06).

To dry-run the agent without posting: `node src/agent/agent.js --once --dry-run`.

## Architecture

Three runtime entry points share a single `src/shared/` library:

- **`src/electron/main.js`** — widget process. Owns the BrowserWindow, IPC, and chooses between *local* and *sync* mode based on whether `settings.hubUrl` is set.
- **`src/hub/server.js`** — Node HTTP hub. Stores device records in `data/devices.json`, exposes `/api/ingest`, `/api/stats`, `/api/stats/stream` (SSE).
- **`src/agent/agent.js`** — headless collector for machines without a widget. Same data path as the widget's sync-mode collector.
- **`worker/src/index.js`** — Cloudflare Worker hub that speaks the same protocol; the aggregation rules must stay portable (no Node built-ins in `usage.js`). The "Deploy to Cloudflare" button isolates `worker/` into a fresh repo, so the Worker may **not** import files above its own dir — its shared closure (`limits.js` / `usage.js` / `history.js` / `projectKey.js`) is vendored into `worker/src/shared/` by `npm run sync:worker` (`scripts/sync-worker-shared.js`). `src/shared/` stays the single source of truth; those copies are `@generated` (a CommonJS `package.json` marker scopes them back to CJS inside the ESM worker) and CI fails on drift. Edit `src/shared/`, never the copies, then re-run the sync.

### Collector pipeline (shared by widget and agent)

`src/shared/collector.js` is the only place that invokes `tokscale`. It:
1. resolves the platform binary from `@tokscale/cli-<platform>-<arch>` and falls back to the JS shim under Electron via `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1`;
2. runs three `tokscale --json --client <csv> --group-by client,model` calls (today / month / since `allTimeSince`) on full ticks (startup / interval / manual) — serially on purpose: concurrent scans triple peak CPU/IO. Watch-triggered ticks instead scan only `--today` and derive month/allTime **exactly** via `applyPeriodDelta()` anchored to the last full scan (every tokscale period scan costs the same full-load+filter, so the win is 3 spawns→1; the delta is an identity for append-only logs, NOT an estimate; stale-date anchors force a full scan);
3. funnels output through the shared extractors in `src/shared/usage.js`, which defensively deep-walk tokscale's JSON shape (they never assume a fixed layout — that's why `tokenValue`/`detectClient` accept many key spellings);
4. watches the per-client data directories from `watchClientRootsForClients()` with chokidar (native events on every platform and in every mode; `resolveWatchUsePolling()` owns that default so entry points can't drift, and `TOKEN_MONITOR_WATCH_POLLING` overrides it in both directions) and debounces refreshes by `watchDebounceMs` (no cooldown — the product promises 3–5 s updates; mid-tick watch events re-arm the debounce timer instead of coalescing). A live watch tick maps the changed path back to its client and scans only that client's `--today` partition; smart mode retains the same mapping plus any tracked self-synced clients until its next active interval. Multiple clients are unioned, while unknown/unattributed paths fall back to an all-client `--today` scan. The cursor/antigravity tokscale cache dirs are deliberately *not* watched — only our own `maybeSync*` calls write them, so watching them re-triggers forever — and those syncs are gated + throttled (`SYNC_MIN_INTERVAL_MS`). Antigravity's *source* roots (`selfSyncSourceRootsForClients()`) are the exception and are watched: tokscale only reads them, writing solely into its own cache dir, so an event there cannot close the loop. `watchIgnoreMatcher()` prunes them to the paths a turn touches and takes `brain/` one level deep — its per-session children are screenshots and plans, hundreds of directories per home for a handful of writes a week, and on Linux that is an inotify descriptor each. Two tick selections shorten the throttle for a named client and are not interchangeable. `forceSelfSync` (`true` for the manual refresh button, `[client]` for a scoped action such as a Cursor sign-in) waits for nothing — the `{ force: true }` refresh that every settings and account flow performs deliberately does not set it, or each one would pay for both sync subprocesses. `sourceSelfSync`, set by a watch event on those source roots, instead drops the client to `SYNC_SOURCE_EVENT_MIN_INTERVAL_MS`, and only while its last attempt succeeded (`sourceFloorMs()`). Keep both distinct from a tick's `todayOnly`: the coalesced replay in `runTick` derives its scan scope from the pending ticks themselves, so that forcing a sync cannot downgrade a manual full scan into a warm one. Both live in `src/shared/selfSyncThrottle.js`, split by lifetime: the throttle is per process (the tokscale cache it guards is one directory on disk, so a collector rebuilt by a settings change must not hand itself a fresh allowance) while the queue of deferred events is per collector, since its timer has to die with the collector that armed it. The rest of that path — deferring rather than dropping an event caught inside the floor, keeping the catch-up targeted and off the coalesce queue, and which attempt owns the failure state — is commented where it happens. The invariant worth preserving from the outside is that the floor and the catch-up deadline each stay a single function: every divergence between copies of them has been a bug. Kernel watch-descriptor exhaustion (`ENOSPC`/`EMFILE`/`ENFILE` — a per-user budget shared with editors, hit first on Linux) arrives as an async watcher error and would otherwise just stop event delivery silently, so it rebuilds the watcher on polling; that fallback is deliberately sticky for the process, because a later rebuild would only rediscover the same exhausted budget.
5. on Windows, also scans usage from **running** WSL distros (`src/shared/wslUsage.js`). It registry-gates on `HKCU\…\Lxss` (so `wsl.exe` is never spawned without WSL — the inbox stub otherwise shows an interactive install prompt), lists running distros via `wsl.exe --list --running` (never auto-starts a stopped one), keeps homes containing tracked-client data, and runs `tokscale --home \\wsl$\<distro>\home\<user>` per home (serial, same CPU/IO reason as above). The bundle is merged into the Windows periods in `collectUsageOnce` **before** `deriveClientStatus` (so a WSL-only client still shows active); `mergePeriods`/`addPeriodInto` (in `usage.js`) do the additive sum. It refreshes on full ticks only and is frozen between them (`wslAnchor` in `startCollector`), so the Windows-only delta anchor stays exact and the chokidar watcher is **not** extended to WSL. Non-`win32` is a no-op. Default on, no setting.

### AI Tool Limits collector

Usage and limits have independent lifecycles under `src/shared/deviceRuntime.js`: `UsageRuntime` owns the tokscale collector, while `LimitsRuntime` owns its refresh timer, bounded cross-provider concurrency, per-provider latest-wins serial lanes, scoped account refreshes, finite probe deadlines, retry/backoff, and `lastGood` / `lastAttempt` retention. Credential changes refresh or clear only the affected limits lane and never restart usage; Cursor additionally forces one targeted usage sync because its tokscale cache is self-synced.

`DeviceState` composes both outputs into the unchanged device wire record, buffering limits until usage exists and cold-start previews until a complete usage baseline exists; limits-only updates preserve the usage `updatedAt`. Provider dispatch starts in `src/shared/limitCollector.js`, with provider-specific implementations split between that file and `src/shared/*Limits.js`; shared normalization remains in `src/shared/limits.js`. The hub and Worker receive the composed record and never need provider credentials.

Balance-style quotas are marked with `windows[].metric === 'credits'`: their headline value is money (`remaining` + `currency`), not a percentage. `src/shared/limitBalanceDisplay.js` is the single formatting/derivation entry point shared by Home, the tray and the limits page — key off that marker, never a provider whitelist. The meter percentage for a top-up balance (`amount / (amount + monthSpend)`) is a **display-layer derivation** and is deliberately kept out of the wire shape; don't push it back into a collector.

### Widget mode switching

`main.js` chooses the data path from `settings.hubMode` (`local` / `client` / `host`, set in the GUI's Multi-device Sync section). In `client` mode (a `hubUrl` is set) it: stops the local collector, opens an SSE stream to `/api/stats/stream`, and *also* runs a sync-collector to post this device's own usage. In `host` mode it additionally runs an embedded hub (`startEmbeddedHub()`) so other devices can connect. In `local` mode it runs only the local collector and emits stats over IPC to the renderer.

When both a widget and the headless agent run on the same machine, the widget's sync-collector backs off — it checks `data/agent.pid` (`pidFilePath()`) and skips posting if that PID is alive. This is the only coordination between them.

### Settings and credentials: env first, GUI overrides for widget

Configuration has two sources, and the widget splits its persisted GUI state by sensitivity:

1. **`.env` at project root** — read by `loadDotEnv()` in `src/shared/config.js` at the top of every entry file. Only assigns keys that aren't already in `process.env`, so real env vars (systemd / launchd / Docker) still win. `.env.example` documents the operator-facing settings intended for direct configuration, including connection/device settings, feature toggles, and provider credentials. Lower-level runtime knobs may still be accepted without being listed there; treat additions or removals from the documented env surface as compatibility changes and keep `.env.example` aligned with the code.
2. **Widget GUI** — Electron `userData/settings.json` stores preferences and account metadata; plaintext `userData/credentials.json` stores GUI-managed raw credentials with restrictive filesystem permissions (POSIX `0600`; Windows relies on the containing `userData` ACL). `readSettings()` merges both over `defaultSettings()` (which is seeded from env), while the main process sends a default-deny redacted view to the renderer. The only explicit renderer exceptions are the two Hub secrets required by the existing sync UI. The headless agent and standalone hub never read `credentials.json`; their credential flow remains CLI/env-based.

`CREDENTIAL_SETTING_PATHS` in `src/shared/credentialStore.js` maps fixed GUI credential settings. Add new fixed credentials there instead of creating provider-specific stores; dynamic account credentials such as MiMo cookies belong under a dedicated nested path in the same unified store and must remain metadata-only in the renderer. Expose any raw credential to the renderer only through an explicit allowlist. Legacy migration must write and verify the new store before stripping/deleting the old source; corrupt, unknown-version, or symlinked stores must never be replaced with an empty document. This store is deliberately local plaintext protected by filesystem permissions, not OS-backed encryption: it avoids Keychain/credential-manager prompts but does not protect against processes already running as the same OS user.

Per-setting precedence for the agent and hub: `CLI flag → env var (real or .env) → built-in default`. There is no JSON config file anymore — `config.local.json` was removed.

### Adding a tracked client

The default client CSV lives in **one** place: `DEFAULT_CLIENTS` in `src/shared/clientTracking.js` (`src/electron/main.js` and `src/agent/agent.js` both derive from it). But adding a *new* client means touching several spots that must all agree on the id:

| Touch point | Where |
|---|---|
| Default client list | `DEFAULT_CLIENTS` in `src/shared/clientTracking.js` |
| Watch paths | the `add(...)` call in `clientWatchCandidates()` (`src/shared/collector.js`) |
| Name normalization | the `normalizeClientName()` branch in `src/shared/usage.js` |
| Renderer maps | `clientLabels` / `clientsWithIcon` / `KNOWN_CLIENTS` in `src/electron/renderer/app.js`; provider artwork in `src/electron/renderer/trayProviderIcons.js`; `VENDOR_ORDER` / `VENDOR_LABELS` in `themePresets.js`; `clientColors` in `usageCharts.js` |
| Discord RPC | `KNOWN_CLIENT_ASSETS` / `CLIENT_LABELS` in `src/electron/discordRpc.js` |
| Row icon CSS | the `.row-icon-<id>` rule in `src/electron/renderer/styles.css` |
| Icon assets | `assets/icons/<id>.svg` + `assets/tools-icon/<id>.png` |
| WSL discovery | marker(s) in `WSL_DATA_MARKERS` **and** the marker→id mapping in `MARKER_CLIENTS` (`src/shared/wslUsage.js`) — use the exact roots tokscale reads, including alternate roots. A marker without a `MARKER_CLIENTS` entry attributes to nothing, so a WSL home holding only that client's data would be skipped |
| Docs & env examples | the supported-tools table in `README.md` and its translations (`README.*.md`) + the client CSV in `.env.example`. Every locale's prose tool/provider counts must match its own table — `tests/docs/readmeConsistency.test.js` fails on a stale count or a table that drifts between locales |
| Guard tests | the expected-client lists in `tests/shared/clientTracking.test.js` |

One caveat on top of the table:

- Self-synced clients (cursor/antigravity) additionally go in `SELF_SYNCED_CLIENTS`; parse-local clients must NOT.
- Targeted watch ticks make the client id a correctness surface, because the scan is keyed on it from two independent directions: `clientWatchCandidates()` decides which id a changed path maps to, and `normalizeClientName()` decides which id tokscale's rows land under. Three invariants keep them aligned — the id must be a fixed point of `normalizeClientName()` (so the partition a targeted scan writes is the one it cleared); every tokscale alias in `TOKSCALE_CLIENT_ALIASES` must normalize back to its parent id and be expanded by `tokscaleClientFilter()` (so targeting the parent still scans the alias, as with `antigravity` / `antigravity-cli`); and the filter must never emit `synthetic`. The first two are correctness: break either and a watch tick zeroes a client's partition, feeding a negative delta into month/allTime until the next full scan. The third is performance — `synthetic` makes tokscale enable *every* client, so the targeted scan silently degrades into a full one with correct numbers and none of the saving. Don't diagnose one as the other. `tests/shared/clientPartitionInvariants.test.js` enforces all three.
- Limits-only providers must keep `LIMIT_PROVIDER_IDS` in `src/shared/limitCollector.js` aligned with renderer `LIMIT_PROVIDERS`, account settings when applicable, tray artwork, and every README table. `LIMIT_PROVIDER_IDS` defines the new-install order; a changed default must not overwrite a saved custom order.

### Data flow contract

The hub stores normalized device records (`normalizeDeviceRecord` in `usage.js`) and aggregates on read (`aggregateDevices`). The wire shape between agent/widget and hub is whatever `collectUsageOnce()` returns — that function is the source of truth, and `docs/API.md` documents the full contract. The core is `{deviceId, hostname, platform, updatedAt, agentVersion, today, month, allTime}` (each period has `{totalTokens, costUsd, clients, clientCosts, models, modelCosts}`), plus attribution fields (`trackedClients`, `clientStatus`, `wslStatus`, `periodWindows`, `projectsEnabled`) and optional `osName` / `osVersion` / `agentRuntime` / `history` / `limits`. The Worker hub uses the exact same shapes.

### Subscriptions are hub-scoped, not device-scoped

Manually recorded subscriptions (`src/shared/subscriptionDisplay.js`) are the one thing a hub stores that is **not** part of a device record. A subscription describes an account, and `accountKey` is not stable across platforms — the collapse pass in `limits.js` exists precisely because the same OAuth login hashes differently on macOS and Windows — so per-device copies could not be deduped and a two-machine setup would double its own monthly total. `GET`/`PUT /api/subscriptions` therefore read and write one shared list per hub; a delete is a delete, with no tombstone needed.

`PUT` carries `baseUpdatedAt` and answers `409` when it does not match the stored document: this data exists nowhere else, so a device writing from a stale copy must not silently erase records added elsewhere. In the widget that token belongs to whoever built the list — the renderer sends back the version its edit was made on — and is never re-derived at write time. Hub reads and writes run in a per-hub lane, but ordering is not re-basing: a write queued behind a refresh that pulled in another device's records is refused, not quietly retargeted at the version that refresh left. In `local` mode the list lives in the widget's `settings.json`; in `client`/`host` mode that key is only the last-known cache, and writes attempted while the hub is unreachable are refused rather than applied locally (a local write would fork the shared list). The list is never part of `publicStats`.

Propagation is by version stamp, not by shipping the list: an accepted `PUT` broadcasts stats the way an ingest does, and every stats frame carries `subscriptionsUpdatedAt`. A device re-reads only when that disagrees with the copy it holds, so an edit lands on the other devices in seconds and the steady state costs nothing — there is deliberately **no periodic subscription read** behind it. Both stats paths feed the comparison: the stream while it is up, and the widget's own `/api/stats` read when it is not (that one is five minutes apart precisely while the stream is up, `restartTimer()`). Four traps. The Worker's `/api/public/stats` spreads the rest of `getStats()`, which is why the stamp is added by a separate `statsWithSubscriptionVersion()` that only the authenticated paths call — fold it back into `getStats()` and the one unauthenticated route both reads the money document and publishes whatever it found. A missing stamp must read as "no news", since that is also what a local collector's own stats look like. The version is compared *inside* the subscription lane rather than before it: only what an in-flight operation leaves behind can tell this device's own write (which lands the broadcast version itself, so nothing needs fetching) from another device's (where a read already in flight answers with the older document). And a failed catch-up must not be retried on every frame, since frames arrive on every ingest from every device — the same version is retried at most once a minute, while a version that moves is tried at once.

### Stale devices

A device is "stale" if `Date.now() - receivedAt > staleAfterMs` (default 10 min). Stale devices still appear in `/api/stats` with `stale: true`, and the renderer greys them out — this is intentional, not a bug.

## Conventions

- **Consider best practices first.** When picking an approach — library vs hand-roll, pattern vs custom, framework default vs override — start by checking the ecosystem convention, not by optimizing for "fewer deps" or "less code". If a hand-rolled solution is genuinely better, argue that *after* weighing the convention.
- **This project has external users.** Settings keys, env vars, CLI flags, hub endpoints, and the wire shape (`docs/API.md`) are compatibility surfaces — treat changes to them as breaking and think about migration. Internal code can still be refactored and renamed freely.
- **Don't add dependencies or new tooling without discussing it first** (in the issue or PR description).
- **Keep this file lean and current.** Document non-obvious constraints and gotchas, not descriptions the code already makes obvious. Avoid hardcoded counts and exhaustive lists (prefer a command like `ls src/shared/` over a hand-maintained one); verify claims against the code before writing them; delete anything that has gone stale — an outdated note is worse than none.

### Commit messages

Format: `<type>(<scope>): <subject>` — conventional-commit types (`feat` / `fix` / `refactor` / `docs` / `chore` / `perf` / `test` / …), with a scope when the change targets a clear subsystem (`fix(hermes):`, `fix(collector):`, `feat(limits):`); leave it off for cross-cutting or general changes. Aim for a subject ≤ ~72 chars that describes the actual change. Add a **body** only when the diff doesn't make the *why* obvious — rationale, rejected alternatives, behaviour-preserving notes, linked issues; trivial changes stay single-line. Write body paragraphs as continuous lines, not hard-wrapped.

**Do:**

```
fix(dashboard): balance stat card widths
feat(wsl): scan usage from running WSL distros
docs(i18n): add Japanese README
```

**Don't** — vague subjects, or internal review/agent jargon (`P0`/`P1`, "review findings", "hardening pass"):

```
fix: address P0 review findings   ❌
fix: hardening pass round 2       ❌
fix: various improvements         ❌
```

Never add an AI `Co-Authored-By` trailer. **Do** keep the genuine human `Co-authored-by:` trailer on a multi-author squash (e.g. a maintainer follow-up on a contributor PR) and keep the `(#NN)` PR-number suffix GitHub appends to squash subjects.

### Pull requests

- PR titles follow the commit-message convention above — they become the squash-merge subject.
- In the description: summarize the behaviour change, note the commands you ran (`npm run verify` at minimum), attach screenshots/GIFs for UI changes, and link the related issue.

### Authoring GitHub content via `gh`

Write PR/issue bodies and comments to a file and pass it, rather than inline heredocs: `gh issue comment --body-file <path>`, `gh api -X PATCH … -F body=@<path>`. Inline `--body "$(cat <<EOF … EOF)"` mangles backtick escaping and renders as a literal `` \` `` in GitHub markdown. Same spirit for prose: write paragraphs as continuous lines and let GitHub wrap them — don't hard-wrap at 80 columns.
